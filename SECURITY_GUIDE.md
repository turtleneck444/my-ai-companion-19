# üîí Security Guide for AI Companion Platform

## ‚úÖ **Your Current Setup is SECURE!**

### **Why Your Empty .env is Actually Good:**
1. **Production Security**: Your API keys are stored in Netlify's secure environment variables
2. **No Local Exposure**: Your `.env` file is empty, so no secrets are exposed locally
3. **Git Safety**: `.env` is in `.gitignore`, so it won't be committed to your repository

## üèóÔ∏è **How Your Architecture Works:**

### **Local Development (Your Machine):**
- Uses `.env` file for API keys
- Keys are stored locally and never committed to git
- Perfect for development and testing

### **Production (Netlify):**
- Uses Netlify's environment variables
- Keys are stored securely in Netlify's dashboard
- Never exposed in your code or repository

## üîß **Setting Up Your Environment:**

### **1. For Local Development:**
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual API keys
nano .env
```

### **2. For Production (Netlify):**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to Site Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add these variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_actual_elevenlabs_key
ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Best Practices:**

### **‚úÖ What You're Doing Right:**
- Environment variables are properly separated
- `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- Production keys are stored in Netlify (not in code)
- API keys are not hardcoded in your source code

### **üîí Additional Security Measures:**

#### **1. API Key Rotation:**
- Rotate your API keys regularly (every 90 days)
- Use different keys for development and production
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity

#### **2. Environment Separation:**
- Never use production keys in development
- Use test/sandbox keys for development
- Keep production keys only in Netlify

#### **3. Access Control:**
- Limit who has access to your Netlify dashboard
- Use strong passwords and 2FA
- Regularly audit who has access to your environment variables

#### **4. Monitoring:**
- Set up API usage alerts
- Monitor for unusual API calls
- Check logs regularly for errors

## üö® **Security Checklist:**

### **Before Going Live:**
- [ ] All API keys are in Netlify environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in your code
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Production keys are different from development keys
- [ ] API usage limits are set appropriately
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### **Ongoing Security:**
- [ ] Regularly rotate API keys
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Review access permissions quarterly
- [ ] Test security measures regularly

## üîç **How to Verify Your Setup:**

### **1. Check Netlify Environment Variables:**
```bash
# In your Netlify dashboard, verify these are set:
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
- ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

### **2. Test Local Development:**
```bash
# Create .env file with your keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual keys
npm run dev
```

### **3. Verify Production:**
- Your site works on Netlify
- AI features function properly
- No errors in browser console
- API calls are successful

## üÜò **If Something Goes Wrong:**

### **API Key Compromised:**
1. Immediately rotate the key in your provider's dashboard
2. Update the key in Netlify environment variables
3. Check API usage logs for unauthorized access
4. Review your code for any exposed keys

### **Environment Variables Not Working:**
1. Check Netlify dashboard for typos
2. Verify variable names match your code
3. Redeploy your site after updating variables
4. Check Netlify function logs for errors

## üéØ **Summary:**

Your current setup is **secure and follows best practices**! The empty `.env` file is actually a good sign - it means you're properly using environment variables for production. Just make sure to:

1. Set up your local `.env` for development
2. Verify all keys are in Netlify
3. Keep your keys rotated and monitored

You're doing great! üöÄ
