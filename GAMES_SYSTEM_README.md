## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### `InteractiveGames.tsx`
Main component that renders all games and manages game state.

#### `game-memory.ts`
Service class for handling game state persistence and memory management.

#### `useGameMemory.ts`
React hook for easy integration of game memory functionality.

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE game_memory (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  memory_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Game State Structure

```typescript
interface GameState {
  gameType: string;
  state: any;
  score: number;
  level: number;
  lastPlayed: string;
  achievements: string[];
  progress: Record<string, any>;
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```tsx
import { InteractiveGames } from '@/components/InteractiveGames';

<InteractiveGames
  characterName="Your AI Companion"
  onBack={() => setShowGames(false)}
  onSendMessage={(message) => handleChatMessage(message)}
/>
```

### Using Game Memory Hook

```tsx
import { useGameMemory } from '@/hooks/useGameMemory';

const { saveGameState, loadGameState, addAchievement } = useGameMemory();

// Save game state
await saveGameState('chess', gameState, score, achievements);

// Load game state
const savedState = loadGameState('chess');

// Add achievement
addAchievement('chess', 'First Win');
```

## Memory Persistence

### Local Storage
Games are automatically saved to localStorage with keys like:
- `gameMemory_guest` (for non-authenticated users)
- `gameMemory_{userId}` (for authenticated users)

### Supabase Sync
For authenticated users, game states are synced to Supabase:
- Automatic sync on state changes
- Cross-device synchronization
- Backup and recovery

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "userId": "user-id",
  "games": {
    "chess": {
      "gameType": "chess",
      "state": { /* game state */ },
      "score": 100,
      "level": 2,
      "lastPlayed": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "achievements": ["First Move", "Strategic Thinker"],
      "progress": { /* progress data */ }
    }
  },
  "totalScore": 500,
  "totalGamesPlayed": 10,
  "favoriteGame": "chess",
  "lastActive": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Testing

### Test Suite
A comprehensive test suite is available in `GameTestSuite.tsx`:
- Individual game testing
- Memory persistence testing
- Integration testing
- Performance testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start a game
2. Make some moves/actions
3. Navigate away and back
4. Verify state is preserved
5. Check scoring and achievements

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Lazy loading of game components
- Efficient state management
- Minimal re-renders
- Optimized memory usage

### Caching
- Game states cached in memory
- Local storage for immediate access
- Supabase for long-term storage

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Multiplayer games
- Tournament mode
- Custom game creation
- Advanced AI opponents
- Social features
- Leaderboards

### Technical Improvements
- WebSocket integration for real-time multiplayer
- Advanced AI algorithms
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced mobile support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Game state not saving**: Check localStorage permissions
2. **Supabase sync failing**: Verify authentication and network
3. **Games not loading**: Check component imports and dependencies

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `localStorage.setItem('debug-games', 'true')`

## Contributing

### Adding New Games
1. Add game type to `GameType` enum
2. Implement game logic in `InteractiveGames.tsx`
3. Add memory persistence support
4. Update test suite
5. Add documentation

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive comments
